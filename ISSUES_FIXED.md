# 🔧 Website Issues Found and Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Mobile Navigation Not Working** ❌➡️✅

- Fixed mobile menu toggle functionality
- Added hamburger menu animation (transforms to X when active)

### 2. **Responsive CSS Outdated** ❌➡️✅

- Updated `@media (max-width: 480px)` queries
- Fixed mobile navigation CSS to work with new structure

### 3. **Missing Mobile Responsive Support for New Sections** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: New sections like `.pillars-grid` and `.footer-links` weren't included in mobile responsive grid layouts.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `.pillars-grid` and `.footer-links` to responsive CSS
- Ensured all new sections are mobile-friendly

### 4. **Mobile Menu Styling Issues** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: Mobile menu had poor styling and wasn't following the design system.

**Fix Applied**:
