                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Living Mercy Presbyterian Church was founded in 1952 by a small group of families who felt called to establish a Presbyterian congregation that would serve both the spiritual and practical needs of the growing community.</p>
                    
                    <p>What began as gatherings in homes quickly grew into a vibrant church family. In 1958, we broke ground on our first sanctuary, and over the decades, we've expanded our facilities to include educational wings, a fellowship hall, and modern worship spaces.</p>
                    
                    <p>Throughout our history, LMPC has been committed to Reformed theology while embracing contemporary worship styles and innovative ministries. We've weathered challenges, celebrated milestones, and consistently focused on our calling to be Christ's hands and feet in our community.</p>
                    
                    <p>Today, we continue to grow as a multigenerational church family, welcoming people from all walks of life to experience God's love and grace together.</p>
